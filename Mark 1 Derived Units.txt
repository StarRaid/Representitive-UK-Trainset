	MARK 1 DERIVED UNITS
	
	1 DIESEL

There were no strictly Mk1 derived units, except Swindon classes 123 and 124.
There were short distance/suburban DMUs, regional DMUs, and some (slightly longer distance ones too)

	1.1 SUBURBAN DMUS
	


	1.2 REGIONAL DMUS & BUBBLE CARS
	


	1.3 CLASSES 123 & 124
	


	2 DIESEL ELECTRIC
	
These were entirely limited to the Southern Region. There are 3 main groups of these.These were the
narrow Hastings Units (201/6H, 202/6S, 203/6L), the older style Hampshire units (205/2H/3H), and the
newer style Sussex units (207/2D/3D). There are also some odds and ends, such as the class 206/3R
'Tadpole' units. These were formed from the left over parts of Hastings and Hampshire untis.

	2.2 HASTINGS UNITS
	
These were narrow bodied units to fit the limited clearance tunnels on the Tonbridge-Hastings line.
The formation of these trains is relatively simple in RUKTS: one narrow driving motor car (DMBS) on
each end, with all carriages in the centre being narrow Mk1 coaches. Some units had compartment
style coaches (with side corridors). Should this allow suburban Mk1s into the units?

	2.3 HAMPSHIRE UNITS

These were units built in the same style as the later BR EPB units. They had compartments throughout.
These are formed in RUKTS with a driving motor vehicle at one end, and a driving trailer (same as used
by the HAP) at the other. The centre carraige(s) reuses the graphics of the suburban Mk1.

	2.4 SUSSEX UNITS
	
These were built in a similar style to CIGs and VEPs, but without end gangways.

	3 AC ELECTRIC
	


	4 DC ELECTRIC
	


	5 TRAILER SETS
	
The Southern Region used trailer sets to allow transfer of sets easily from electric to diesel traction.
They are visually identical to CIGs, with different layouts. They all have full open layouts, and centre
cars will reuse CIG driving car graphics, and have specific brake car graphics, with all other trailers 
using standard Mk1 graphics. They were push-pull compatible with 73s and 33s. A reason to use these over
simple Mk1 coaches is yet to be determined.
